## "squadContainer" :: Team Employee Summary CLI Generator

## Description
Project is designed to demonstrate a thorough understanding of Javascript, Node and various Node Modules by creating a Command Line Application. This application will receive input from user, retrieving employee information and designating common and unique details for each person. Multiple employees are able to be inputted until the User decides to stop adding. Upon completion of final employee information input, a "Team.html" file is dynamically created in "output" directory for the User to view in a browser.
